## R2,C2,S4,6,7,22-24,B6,7,13,14,18,19,22,NM

An active rule that has a common [P38] oscillator and a glide-symmetric [4c/16o].

It also has a sparky [4c/27d] which has yet to be turned into a rake / puffer.

The [P38] oscillator can also hassle still lives and form non-trivial oscillators such as the [P152].
