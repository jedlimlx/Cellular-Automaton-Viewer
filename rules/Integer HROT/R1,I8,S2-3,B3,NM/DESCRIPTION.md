## IntegerLife (R1,I8,S2-3,B3,NM)

A chaotic rule by Mark Niemiec. All patterns in Life work excluding those involving B6. 
Other than the glider and the xWSS, this rule also has a natural [2c/6o], [c/3o] and [3c/11o]. 
There is also a natural [backrake] and a [gun] has been constructed.
This collection excludes Life patterns.
