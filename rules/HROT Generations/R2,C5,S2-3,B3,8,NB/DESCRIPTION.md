## CheckerboardPedestrianLife

A checkerboard rule with a variety of speeds including [7c/171o], [(1, 7)c/14] and a common photon.

There is also a [diagonal rake] and [orthogonal puffer]. The latter can be corderised to form a P24 photon.

In addition, a handful of oscillator periods have been found with the most common being the rotating [P24].
