A stable snoitreneg rule with common [P4] oscillators and a [c/2o]. Still lives exist although they are fairly uncommon.

The [P4] oscillator can [eat](INT_1.rle) the [c/2o] and the [c/2o] can pass through the [P4] [destroying](INT_2.rle) it.

In fact, any oscillator and spaceship pair that each have consist of only one state and have opposite states 
are able to destroy the other without being affected.
