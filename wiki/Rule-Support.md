# Higher Range Outer Totalistic (HROT)

HROT rules are outer totalistic rules that make use of neighbourhoods with range larger than 1. <br>
CAViewer supports arbitrary neighbourhoods via the [CoordCA format](https://github.com/saka29/CoordCA#rule-format) (Specify with N@). <br>
CAViewer also supports arbitary weighted neighbourhoods & state weights via the [LifeViewer format](https://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1622&start=1677) (Specify with NW).<br>
In addition, weighted neighbourhoods can be specified in the neighbourhood selector in the HROT rule dialog. <br>

Rules on triangular and hexagonal tilings are also supported. 
Append H for hexagonal or T for triangular to the custom neighbourhood / weights specifier 
to get the rule on a hexagonal or triangular grid.

####  Supported / Planned Named HROT Neighbourhoods
- [x] Asterisk (A)
- [x] Checkerboard (B)
- [x] Aligned Checkerboard (b)
- [x] Circular (C)
- [ ] Triangular Neighbourhood on Triangular Grid (D)
- [x] Gaussian Weighted Neighbourhood (G)
- [x] Hexagonal (H)
- [x] Triangular Moore (L)
- [x] Moore (M)
- [x] Von Neumann (N)
- [ ] Triangular Neighbourhood on Hexagonal Grid (T)
- [x] Saltire (X)
- [x] Euclidean (2)
- [x] Tripod (3)
- [ ] Hexagram (6)
- [x] Star (*)
- [x] Cross (+)
- [x] Hash (#)
- [x] CoordCA Format (Custom Neighbourhoods @)
- [x] LifeViewer Format (Weighted Neighbourhoods W)
- [x] LifeViewer Format (State Weights W)

Use N@ with no extra hex digits if you specify the neighbourhood / state weights in the neighbourhood / state weights selector.

#### How do (weighted) neighbourhoods work?
Take this neighbourhood as an example:
```
0,0,1,0,0
0,1,1,1,0
1,1,x,1,1
0,1,1,1,0
0,0,1,0,0
```

If the cells around it are in this configuration:
```
0,0,1,0,1
1,0,1,0,0
0,1,x,1,0
0,1,1,1,0
0,0,0,0,1
```

Then, the cell has 7 neighbours as 7 cells coincide with the '1's on the neighbourhood.

Now what if I had this weighted neighbourhood and the same configuration:
```
0,0,-1,0,0
0,1,1,1,0
-1,1,x,1,-1
0,1,1,1,0
0,0,-1,0,0
```

Then the cell would have a neighbourhood sum of `6 * 1 + 1 * -1 = 5`.

For multi-state rules such as generations, state weights can also be used. <br>
The cell will be added to the neighbourhood sum with a value of `neighbourhood weight * state weight`. <br>

Alive cells in 2-state rules have a state weight of 1 and dead cells have a state weight of 0. <br>

#### Rule Format
Weights should be expressed in this format in RLE files as comments (ensure the use of #R)
```
#R 1 2 3 2 1
#R 2 4 6 4 2
#R 3 6 9 6 3
#R 2 4 6 4 2
#R 1 2 3 2 1
```

State weights are placed below neighbourhood weights and are written as follows. <br>
The first number represents the state weight of the 0th state and so on.
```
#R 0 1 0 0 2 -1 0 0
```

So a RLE file for a weighted rule should look like this:
```
#R 0 0 1 0 0 
#R 0 1 2 1 0 
#R 1 2 0 2 1 
#R 0 1 2 1 0 
#R 0 0 1 0 0
x = 2, y = 2, rule = R2,C2,S2-3,B4,7-8,N@
o$bo!
```

This only applies to pattern files. <br>
For neighbourhood weights in the rule dialog, use the neighbourhood weight selector or express weighted rules with `NW` and the [LifeViewer format](https://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1622&start=1677).

## 2 state
* Cells have 2 states, dead and alive. <br>
* Cells are born (turn from dead to alive) if they have X neighbours and X is in birth. <br>
* Cells stay alive if they have X neighbours and X is in survival. <br>
* If not, the cell dies (turn from alive to dead). <br>

B0 rules are supported via emulation by alternating rules. See [this](http://golly.sourceforge.net/Help/Algorithms/QuickLife.html) for information on the alternating rules are generated.

Apgtable generation is supported for normal rules, B0 rules and weighted rules. <br>
Note that the generated apgtables for weighted rules can be several gigabytes in size if you are using a large neighbourhood like R2 Moore.

The code that simulates HROT rules can be found [here](../src/main/java/sample/model/rules/hrot/HROT.java).

## Generations
Generations rules are a multistate generalization of 2 state rules in which live cells can exist in different states, and cells that would die in a 2-state cellular automaton instead advance to the next state.

The name "Generations" is due to the conceptualisation of this process as cells "getting older" before eventually dying

* A dead cell
   * Will become alive if it has X neighbours and X is in birth.
   * If not, it stays dead.
* A living cell
   * Will stay alive if it has X neighbours and X is in survival.
   * If not, it advances to state 2 in the next generation of the pattern.
* A cell in state m â‰¥ 2 will advance to state ((m + 1) mod n) in the next generation of the pattern.

B0 rules are supported via emulation with alternating rules. See [this](./Rule-Support.md#b0-rules) for more information.

State weights can also be used with generations rules. By default, all states have a state weight of 0 except the alive state. <br>
This extension of generations rules is known as [Weighted Generations](http://www.mirekw.com/ca/rullex_wgen.html).

The code that simulates HROT Generations rules can be found [here](../src/main/java/sample/model/rules/hrot/HROTGenerations.java).

R\<range\>,C\<states\>,S\<survival\>,B\<birth\>,NW\<Neighbourhood Weights\>,\<State Weights\> <br>

## Extended Generations
Extended Generations rules are a generalisation of Generations rules. 
This extension explores the result of changing the amounts of time cells can be active/inactive for, 
and also of allowing cells to "come back" from inactivity and alternate between being active/inactive an 
indefinite amount of times before dying.

* An active cell
    * Remains in its current state if it has X neighbours and X is in survival
    * If not, it advances to state ((x + 1) mod y) in the next generation of the pattern where x is the current state and y is the total number of states.
* An inactive cell
    * Advances to state ((x + 1) mod y) in the next generation of the pattern where x is the current state and y is the total number of states. 
      It behaves like a normal Generations dying cell.
* A dead cell
    Advances to state 1 if it has X neighbours and X is in birth.
* If not, it remains dead.

The code that simulates HROT Extended Generations rules can be found [here](../src/main/java/sample/model/rules/hrot/HROTExtendedGenerations.java).

## Deficient Rules
In deficient rules, after a cell is born with birth transition B, a dead cell in its neighbourhood 
cannot be born with the same birth transition. This deficiency will go away after the cell survives for a generation. 
If there is permanent deficiency, the cell will remain deficient forever until it dies.
This allows typically explosive rules such as B1 and B2 rules to be stable.

The code that simulates HROT Integer rules can be found [here](../src/main/java/sample/model/rules/hrot/DeficientHROT.java).

## Integer Rules
An extension of a rule described by Mark Niemiec called Integer Life.

* At every step, a cell's neighborhood sum is the arithmetic sum of the values of its neighbors.
* If a cell is dead and has a neighborhood of exactly Xn and X is in the birth conditions, 
a new cell of value n is born there; otherwise it stays dead. If a cell can be born into mulitple states, the lowest is chosen.
* If a cell is alive (n > 0), and has exactly Xn neighbors and X is in the survival conditions, 
it remains alive; otherwise, it dies.
* Survival occurs in the range [Xn, (X+1)n)
* If a cell's state exceeds the maximum state, it dies.

## Regenerating Generations
This is an extension of generations rules that allows dying to regenerating (ie. progress back to the alive state).

* A dead cell
    * Goes to the birth state if it has X neighbours and X is in birth
    * If not, it remains dead
* An alive cell
    * Remains alive if it has X neighbours and X is in survival
    * If not it goes to state 2
* A dying cell (state 2 and above)
    * Goes the state (n - 1) if it has X neighbours and X is in regen birth
    * Remains at the same state if it has X neighbours and X is in regen survival
    * Else, it progresses to the (n + 1) % m state

# History Rules
History rules have 7 or more states. They are based on the HistoricalLife rule. See [here](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/OCA:LifeHistory) 
for more information.

History rules are (planned to be) supported by:
- [x] 2-state HROT
- [ ] HROT Generations
- [ ] HROT Extended Generations


# B0 rules
CAViewer makes use of a generalised B0 algorithm to emulate B0 rules.
Let's say the transition function is *c* = f(*x*, *n*) where *c* is the cell's next state, *x* is the cell's current state and *n* is the cell's neighbours.
To emulate a B0 rule, we need to ensure the background is 0 at all times. So let's say *B* is a list of background that the rules moves across.
The rule will alternate across *l* rules where *l* is the length of *B*.
Every generation, before inputting the cells into *f(x, n)*, we swap 0 and *B\[generation % l\]*. A similar function is applied to the output.

With that, we have successfully emulated a B0 rule!
