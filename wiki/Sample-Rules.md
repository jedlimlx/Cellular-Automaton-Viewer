| Name | Character | Rulestring | Description | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [?](../rules/HROT/R2,C2,S0-3,B0,2-4,N+/DESCRIPTION.md) | Chaotic | R2,C2,S0-3,B0,2-4,N+ | This B0 cross rule has a rotating P264 and wide variety of oscillators formed from interactions of the common sparky P2 and P4 oscillators. There is also a c/34o spaceship.
| [?](../rules/HROT/R2,C2,S2,B3,9,NN/DESCRIPTION.md) | Stable | R2,C2,S2,B3,9,NN | A stable rule that has a variety of natural speeds as well as an (5, 8)c/18 puffer that can be corderised. There is also a common P8 oscillator that looks like a shaker. In addition, there is a common still life that looks like a sideways 8. It is formed from a beehive predecessor.
| [DuopletLife](../rules/HROT/R2,C2,S2-3,B4,7-8,NW0010001210120210121000100/DESCRIPTION.md) | Chaotic | R2,C2,S2-3,B4,7-8,NW0010001210120210121000100 | A weird rule with an overabundance of P2 duoplets. Has some oscillators as well as a 2c/8d, 4c/16d, c/13o spaceships and a 5c/10d duoplet puffer. Can someone corderise the puffer? |
| [?](../rules/HROT/R2,C2,S4,6-7,22-24,B6-7,13-14,18-19,22,NM/DESCRIPTION.md) | Chaotic | R2,C2,S4,6-7,22-24,B6-7,13-14,18-19,22,NM  | An active rule that has a common P38 oscillator and a glide-symmetric 4c/16o. It also has a sparky 4c/27d which has yet to be turned into a rake / puffer. The P38 oscillator can also hassle still lives and form non-trivial oscillators such as the P152. |
| [?](../rules/HROT/R3,C2,S6-9,20-24,B6-8,20,NB/DESCRIPTION.md) | Chaotic | R3,C2,S6-9,20-24,B6-8,20,NB | An extremely active but not explosive rule. The most common oscilator is a P2 phoenix. There is also a odd-looking P16. There are also a number of photons and 2 c/2d spaceships.
| [?](../rules/HROT/R3,C2,S6-9,B7-10,NB/DESCRIPTION.md) | Chaotic | R3,C2,S6-9,B7-10,NB  | An active checkerboard rule with 2 common photons and common P4 oscillators. Has P1 & P2 photons as well as a 2c/10o spaceship. |


## Generations

| Name | Character | Rulestring | Description | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [WalledChaos](../rules/HROT%20Generations/R1,C3,S,B0,3-4,NM/DESCRIPTION.md) | Stable / Chaotic | R1,C3,S,B0,3-4,NM | A stable / chaotic B0 generation that walls itself up. As the pattern evolves, walls tend to form around the main pattern and prevent its expansion. Oscillators of various periods have been found.
| [?](../rules/HROT%20Generations/R1,C4,S,B0,4,NN/DESCRIPTION.md) | Expanding | R1,C4,S,B0,4,NN | This rule exhibits complex and interesting behaviour. Checkerboard agars tend to be formed and most patterns exist in the checkerboard agars. Spaceships (namely P1 photons) form in the checkerboard agar and expand it when they collide with its edges. Wickstretchers are also common.
| [FlashingSpirals](../rules/HROT%20Generations/R1,C5,S,B0,NN/DESCRIPTION.md) | Expanding | R1,C5,S,B0,NN | A B0 generations rule that has spiral generators similar to that in many normal generations rule but they *FLASH* and they are slower due to the strobing background. "that looks like regular generations spiral generators but more seizure√© epileptique" - Saka
| [CheckerboardPedestrainLife](../rules/HROT%20Generations/R2,C5,S2-3,B3,8,NB/DESCRIPTION.md) | Chaotic | R2,C5,S2-3,B3,8,NB | A checkerboard rule with a variety of speeds including 7c/171o, (1, 7)c/14 and a common photon. There is also a diagonal rake and orthogonal puffer. The latter can be corderised to form a P24 photon. In addition, a handful of oscillator periods have been found with the most common being the rotating P24.
| [?](../rules/HROT%20Generations/R2,C6,S2,5-9,B3-4,10,NN/DESCRIPTION.md) | Explosive | R2,C6,S2,5-9,B3-4,10,NN | An explosive generations rule that has similar dynamics to star wars. However, unlike Star Wars, in this rule, stable circuitry is hard to construct. Most ships move at lightspeed. There is also a common c/2o ship and a 2c/4d ship.
| [?](../rules/HROT%20Generations/R3,C5,S6-10,B4,10,N2/DESCRIPTION.md) | Stable | R3,C5,S6-10,B4,10,N2 | A stable rule that has a common (28, 16)c/38 and c/1d. There is also a P30 oscillator.
