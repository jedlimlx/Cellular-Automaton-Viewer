Rule Format (.ca_rule)
--------------
Name: Hello World (Can be Anything you like)

Neighbourhood Range: 2 (Can be Any Number, >3 gets slow)

Neighbourhood: (Use Commas, Numbers are Weights, For Alternating Place '-' below it and continue)
0,0,0,0,0
0,1,1,1,0
0,1,0,1,0
0,1,1,1,0
0,0,0,0,0
######### (As many as you like, Recommended is Same Length)
0,0,1,0,0
0,1,1,1,0
1,1,0,1,1
0,1,1,1,0
0,0,1,0,0

State Weights: 0,1 -> Separate by Commas, For Alternating Put | (No Max, Don't Leave Spaces)

Rulespace: BSFKL / Extended Generations / Outer Totalistic
Will Add 3-state Outer Totalistic and Range 2 Isotropic Von Neumann (Need Help with This) Soon

Rulestring: -> For Alternating Put | (No Max, Don't Leave Spaces)
b1s2f3k4l5 or 1/2/3/4/5 (BSFKL)
b3,4,5s4d1-1-1 or 4/3,4,5/1-1-1 (Extended Generations)
b3s2,3 or 2,3/3 (Outer Totalistic)

(Must Add Commas because of Extended Neighbourhood, Don't Leave Spaces)

Colour Palette: -> RGB (To Tell Program to Auto Generate Put None Below Colour Palette)
1 (0, 0, 0)
2 (255, 255, 255)
